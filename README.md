This repository contains a Power BI project analyzing car sales data from Kaggle. The analysis explores sales trends, customer preferences, regional variations, and car model performances over a two-year period.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle: Car Sales Analysis Dashboard](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/safaeahb/car-sales-analysis-dashboard?select=car+sales.csv).

## Insights

- **Sales Over Time:** Sales remain relatively stable throughout the year with a sharp increase in September and further rise in the fourth quarter. This likely correlates with back-to-school periods and holiday seasons such as Christmas.
  
- **Color Preferences:** White is the most popular car color, followed by black and red.
  
- **Regional Sales:** Sales distribution reflects population density and accessibility, with higher sales in towns and suburbs where conventional transportation options are limited.
  
- **Gender Distribution:** The gender ratio of buyers remains consistent over the two years.
  
- **Car Models:** The Lexus LS400 leads in revenue, while the Oldsmobile Silhouette has the highest number of sales.
  
- **Transmission Type:** There is no clear preference between automatic and manual transmissions.
  
- **Brand Preferences:** American-made cars are preferred, followed by German brands, with other brands evenly distributed.
